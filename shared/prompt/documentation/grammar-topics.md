# Grammar topics

Three books (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) are organized by **study_guide**
into **17 major topics**. Units in each book map to these topics; the same topic
may appear across levels with different depth.

**Unit IDs in data**: `unit_1`, `unit_2`, … (from `metadata.unit_ids`). Ranges
below use **unit numbers** (e.g. 1–6 = unit_1 … unit_6).
