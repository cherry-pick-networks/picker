  Use only CAF allowlist terms for hierarchy (layer) component names —
  directory segments, document segments, and layer naming. See RULESET.md §E.

When creating or renaming **directory segments**, **document segments**, or
**layer components** (Component 1–5):

- Use **only** terms from the **CAF allowlist** for each component. Do not
  invent or use ad-hoc names.
- **Allowlist source**: `sharepoint/context/documentation/MANUAL.md` § CAF
  allowlist specification. Canonical data:
  `pipeline/structureAddDirConfigSetsData.ts` (COMPONENT1_WORKLOAD,
  COMPONENT2_RESOURCE_TYPE, COMPONENT3_ENVIRONMENT, COMPONENT4_REGION;
  Component 5 = 4-digit numeric).
- **Component roles**: Component 1 = workload; Component 2 = resource type
  (major as-is, non-major full form per CAF spec); Component 3 = environment;
  Component 4 = region; Component 5 = 4 digits or allowlist/document term.
- Applies to: new directories, renamed path segments, document/rule segment
  names, and any naming of layer components. Run
  `deno task rules:summary -- directory` for §F, §D, §E.
