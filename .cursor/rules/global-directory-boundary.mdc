When adding or changing directories (task type directory): apply RULESET.md §F,
§D, §E.

**Todo:** Create new directories only via
`deno task structure:add-dir -- <path>`. Do not create directories by hand or in
the editor. Run the command from project root with a root-relative path (e.g.
`system/app/notifications`). The path must follow prefix/infix/suffix (max 5
components) and §E allowed segment names.
