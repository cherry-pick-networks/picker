This rule is defined in `shared/prompt/store.md`.
Read that file and follow:
- **§C. Language**
- **§I. Agent principles**
- **§O. Answer format (options with pros and cons)**
For handoff or long sessions, also follow **§B. Commit and session boundary**.
Do not duplicate the rule text here.

For other rules, use the Rule index in shared/prompt/store.md. Run
`deno task rules:summary -- <task-type>` to get the list of applicable
sections for your current task, or use the relevant context skill. For code or
refactor tasks: run rules:summary for the task type at the start (e.g.
/rules-summary feature) and apply the listed §. When rule
compliance check (e.g. §P, §N) or heavy/parallel verification is needed, use
**rules-subagent** (guide.md "Subagents for rules").
