When creating or editing data that uses classification fields (concept IDs,
subject_ids, content_type_id, cognitive_level_id, context_ids, document_type,
type for source), use **only** values from the allowlist.

- **Allowlist source**: `shared/prompt/documentation/reference.md` § Classification allowlists. Canonical data: `shared/infra/seed/ontology/global-standards.toml`.
- **Do not** invent new codes or labels (e.g. new doctype or CEFR levels). To add values, update global-standards.toml and run `deno task seed:ontology`, then update reference.md if the summary list there is maintained.
- Applies to: Item/content payloads, Source payloads, seed/ontology files, and any code or prompts that output or validate concept IDs.
