When creating or editing data that uses classification fields (concept IDs,
subject_ids, content_type_id, cognitive_level_id, context_ids, document_type,
type for source), use **only** values from the allowlist.

- **Allowlist source**: Canonical data is `sharepoint/infra/seed/ontology/global_standards.toml`. Summary in `sharepoint/context/config/MANUAL.md` § Classification allowlists.
- **Do not** invent new codes or labels. To add values, update global_standards.toml and run `deno task seed:ontology`; optionally update MANUAL.md summary.
- Applies to: Item/content payloads, Source payloads, seed/ontology files, and any code or prompts that output or validate concept IDs.
