This rule is defined in `shared/prompt/documentation/reference.md`.
Read that file and follow **System structure (system/ infix/suffix)**.
When creating or renaming directories or files under system/, use only
allowed infix (actor, content, source, script, record, kv, audit, app) and
suffix (endpoint, service, store, schema, types, validation, log, config).
Do not duplicate the rule text here.
