  Line and file length for TypeScript. Apply when editing .ts.
globs: ["**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: false

This rule is defined in `shared/prompt/store.md`.
Read that file and follow **§P. Format limits (code)**. After writing code,
run `deno fmt` then `deno task line-length-check`; if line-length fails on
imports or long strings, apply the line-break patterns in store.md §P.
Do not duplicate the rule text here.
