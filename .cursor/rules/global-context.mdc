See Rule index in sharepoint/context/RULESET.md. Use
`deno task rules:summary -- <task-type>` or the matching skill for the current
context. The "matching" skill is defined by the task-type → skill mapping
below; request that skill by name when the task type applies.

**Task-type → skill (request this skill by name when applicable):**

| Task type        | Skill name               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| feature + code    | feature-implementation   |
| refactor + code   | refactor-and-commit      |
| docs              | docs-and-boundary       |
| commit            | commit-boundary         |
| migration         | migration-and-naming   |

For other task types (system, dependency, sql, directory), use
`deno task rules:summary -- <task-type>`; no dedicated skill is listed here.

When the task is code, docs, commit, or migration: request this Rule
(global-context) or global-code (when editing .ts) so the applicable § and
skill are applied.
