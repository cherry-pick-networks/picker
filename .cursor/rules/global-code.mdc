  TypeScript editing: apply code-related § from Rule index (e.g. §P, §Q, §S,
  §T, §N). For new features use rules:summary -- feature; for refactor use
  rules:summary -- refactor.

This rule is defined in sharepoint/context/RULESET.md. When editing .ts, follow the
sections for code context from the Rule index (e.g. §P, §Q, §S, §T, §N). Run
`deno task rules:summary -- feature` or `-- refactor` as needed. For feature
work request **feature-implementation** skill; for refactor request
**refactor-and-commit** skill.

**TS filenames**: Base name = default export name; camelCase for
function/module, PascalCase for class/singleton (RULESET.md §E). To Do / Not To Do
checklist: sharepoint/context/config/MANUAL.md (TypeScript filename).
