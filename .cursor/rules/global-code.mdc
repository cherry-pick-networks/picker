  §T, §N). For new features use rules:summary -- feature; for refactor use
  rules:summary -- refactor.

This rule is defined in shared/prompt/store.md. When editing .ts, follow the
sections for code context from the Rule index (e.g. §P, §Q, §S, §T, §N). Run
`deno task rules:summary -- feature` or `-- refactor` as needed.
