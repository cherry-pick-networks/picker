# Pre-push

Run `deno task pre-push` (same checks as CI). Reference store.md §5, §7.

- If it fails: identify the cause from the output, fix the issues, then run
  again until it passes.
- Code must satisfy §P (function body 2–4 statements; async only when body uses
  await). Do not duplicate rule text; reference store.md.
