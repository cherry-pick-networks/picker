# Session goal

Treat the user's message as the session goal. State it in one short sentence (under 15 words or ~40
characters). Reference guide.md "Session start".

- If the goal involves **code changes**: ensure we are on a branch that is not the default (create
  one from default if needed), then proceed.
- **Format**: One sentence; one task or one question. Add context in a follow-up message if needed.
- Templates (guide.md): Task = `[todo/target] + [what to do]`; Analysis =
  `[symptom/error] + find cause`; Refactor = `[target] + [direction]`.
